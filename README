# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a Python-based sentiment analysis tool that classifies movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either 'positive' or 'negative'. It uses various Naive Bayes classifiers and evaluates their performance.

## Project Overview

The script performs the following steps:
1.  Loads the IMDB movie review dataset.
2.  Performs extensive text preprocessing, including:
    -   Removing HTML tags.
    -   Converting text to lowercase.
    -   Removing special characters.
    -   Removing common English stopwords.
    -   Applying Porter Stemming to reduce words to their root form.
3.  Converts the cleaned text data into numerical vectors using `CountVectorizer`.
4.  Trains three different Naive Bayes models: **Gaussian**, **Multinomial**, and **Bernoulli**.
5.  Evaluates each model based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
6.  Generates and saves visualizations comparing the models' performance.
